This report examines the aerodynamic characteristics of a NACA 0012 aerofoil in a wind tunnel, measuring lift and drag across angles of attack. Using pressure taps and a Pitot rake, data showed a linear lift increase to stall, with low drag at small angles and a sharp rise at higher angles due to flow separation. Tunnel effects were minor at low angles but significant at higher ones. Discrepancies with XFOIL and Thin Airfoil Theory were due to flow separation, viscosity, and tunnel confinement, highlighting the need for corrections and the limits of theoretical models.
